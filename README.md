# Burger App

This app helps track burger orders. Orders can be added the the 'Burgers Comin' Up' section, then switched to the 'Devoured' section by clicking a button. This site is organized in an MVC format with a models folder to add functions to the variable burger, a views folder with handlebars files as templates to render data, and a conrollers folder with a homemade orm.js, for 'object relational mapping' of different sql queries to the orm object, and a connection.js file to establish connection to the database. The database is set up with a schema and seeds within the db folder. The handlebars separate the orders being prepared to those served by sorting by data attributes.

(Note, this app would be improved with a delete button and will be added soon. A delete button will enable the entries to be cleared).
